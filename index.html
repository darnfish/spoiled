      <h1>What is the <spoiler>Merge?</spoiler></h1>

      <p>
        The <spoiler>Beacon Chain</spoiler> is a crucial component of Ethereum 2.0, introduced as
        part of Ethereum's transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus
        mechanism. It was launched on December 1, 2020, and played a pivotal role in Ethereum's
        significant upgrade known as "The Merge" which occurred on September 15, 2022.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary purpose of the Beacon Chain is to manage the <code>PoS protocol</code> and
        <spoiler
          >coordinate the network of <span class="inline-tag">Ethereum</span> stakers. Before
          validators began validating actual Ethereum blocks, the Beacon Chain served as a ledger of
          accounts that orchestrated this network of stakers. It's important to note that
        </spoiler>
        the Beacon Chain doesn't process transactions or handle smart contract interactions; these
        are functions of the execution layer of Ethereum.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Another significant aspect of the Beacon Chain is its role in setting up sharding for
        Ethereum. Sharding is expected to further scale the Ethereum network by dividing its
        responsibilities across multiple chains. Proof-of-Stake, with its registry of approved block
        producers, provides a reliable framework for implementing sharding, unlike PoW.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The Beacon Chain introduced staking to Ethereum. In staking, ETH is staked to activate
        validator software, which creates and validates new blocks in the chain. This approach
        replaced mining, the primary mechanism under PoW, and is seen as more secure and
        decentralized. Staking requires validators to lock up assets as collateral, which gives the
        protocol a means to punish bad actors, in contrast to mining that didnâ€™t have such a
        requirement.
