      <h1>砂の女 <spoiler>Woman in the Dunes</spoiler></h1>

      <p>
        Woman in the Dunes was nominated for an Oscar and is generally considered his masterpiece.
        <spoiler>(Teshighara was the first Japanese director ever nominated.)</spoiler> It stars
        <i>Eiji Okada</i>, who had come to international attention in Alain Resnais&apos; Hiroshima,
        Mon Amour. Kyoko Kishida, who plays the woman, had a long career. Teshighara used her
        several times again, and she appeared in Ozu&apos;s last film, An Autumn Afternoon (which
        will be shown again in our Auteurist Reprise series on May 26).

        The eroticism and nudity was very un-Japanese for mainstream cinema of the period, although
        our own former curator, Donald Richie, was already shocking some Tokyo sensibilities with
        what amounted to <code>“X-rated”</code> underground films. As the critic Gudrun Howarth
        wrote,
        <spoiler
          >“When the woman washing the man reacts to the touch of his skin and to the patterns of
          soap lather on his flesh, the sensual, almost tactile, participation of Teshigahara&apos;s
          camera creates one of the most <span class="inline-tag">erotic</span> love scenes ever
          photographed.”</spoiler
        >
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Teshigahara&apos;s breakthrough film was Pitfall, adapted by Kobe Abe from his novel, and
        the two would collaborate again on
        <spoiler class="dark-theme">砂の女 Suna No Onna (Woman in the Dunes)</spoiler>. Abe was a
        member of the avant-garde who would be nominated several times for the Nobel Prize for
        Literature.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Teshigahara was a highly diversified member of the avant-garde arts community, a painter and
        sculptor as well as a filmmaker, and he was also skilled in ikebana (Japanese flower
        arrangement), of which his father had been a grand master. In the course of his career, he
        made several documentaries on artists like Antonio Gaudi and Jean Tinguely.
